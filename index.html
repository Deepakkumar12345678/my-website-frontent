        <p class="section-sub-tag">Aarav had studied till class twelve, which in Sonapur made him "educated." People respected him, but respect did not put food on the plate. His father had died years ago in an accident at a nearby brick kiln. His mother worked in other people's houses, washing dishes and clothes, her hands permanently rough, her back permanently bent. "Education doesn't fill stomachs," people said. Aarav heard this sentence every day. Yet every night, under the weak light of a kerosene lamp, he read old books he borrowed from a school teacher who had once believed in him. The pages smelled of dust and time, but to Aarav, they smelled like escape.</p>
